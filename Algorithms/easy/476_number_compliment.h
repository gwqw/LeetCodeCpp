/**
    476. Number Complement

Given a positive integer, output its complement number. 
The complement strategy is to flip the bits of its binary representation.
Note:
The given integer is guaranteed to fit within the range of a 32-bit signed integer.
You could assume no leading zero bit in the integerâ€™s binary representation.

Example 1:
Input: 5
Output: 2
Explanation: The binary representation of 5 is 101 (no leading zero bits), and its complement is 010. So you need to output 2.

Example 2:
Input: 1
Output: 0
Explanation: The binary representation of 1 is 1 (no leading zero bits), and its complement is 0. So you need to output 0.

Algo1:
- go from begin while bit is 0:
- number << n 
- !number
- number >> n

Algo2: binary search
100     shl
101     num
1000    shr
shl <= num < shr
shl = 0, shr = 31
while shr - shl > 1:
    - m = (shl + shr) / 2
    - num cmp 1 << m
101
111 xor
010

(1 << shl) + ((1 << shl)-1)
10000 + 1111

Algo3: 
mask = num
001????
mask |= mask >> 1;
0011???
mask |= mask >> 2;
...
mask |= mask >> 16;
